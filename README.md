# KYC Documents Directory

This directory is used by the KYC Agent to process and store KYC-related documents.

## Structure

Place your KYC documents here for processing by the agent. Supported file types typically include:

- PDF documents (ID cards, passports, utility bills)
- Image files (JPG, PNG)
- Text documents

## Usage

The agent working directory is set to this folder, so all file operations will be performed here by default.
